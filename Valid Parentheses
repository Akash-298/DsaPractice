We can use a stack to store characters of the string.
Then we can do two things:
1. if char is open bracket (i.e. '(' or '{' or '[') then push it in stack.
2. if char is closed bracket therefore we can check the following conditions:

   1: if '{' is before '}'.
   2: if '(' is before ')'.
   3: if '[' is before ']'.

   If any condition is false then return false.
